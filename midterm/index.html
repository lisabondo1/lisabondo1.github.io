        Then lotsa late nights on the town in San Francisco in the sixties.. but where to find a real natural 
        casing hot dog? Forget it. Doggie Diner was convenient, but ... top dog time! Sampling around for the 
        best frankfurter to sell (and eat!) led to other fine sausages and the idea was born to offer them as 
        hot dogs as well. When no right site could be found in S.F. or Sausalito, hello, Berkeley. That was 1966 
        and with the paint hardly dry we opened on —surprise— a home football game day. Fifteen minutes later it 
        was full house madness. Talk about learning to host and cook on the run!

        With such fans it's been interesting, often challenging — but fun. As in that boy's world, largely gone 
        by, we continue to seek out the best sausage from the best sausage-makers who, born to a tradition of 
        taste, we believe, tend to serve it better. Calabrese? How ya gonna top S.F.'s award-winning house of 
        Molinari? Buon Gusto! Or that little Portuguese plant in San Leandro that makes but two products, one 
        of which, the linguiça, we are proud to say, stands pork shoulder butt higher than any of its competitors 
        in the Bay Area. Then there's the cooked bratwurst from Saag's — as authentic an old-world European taste 
        as you're likely to find.

                              Load up on sauerkraut and that was dinner.  I can't believe nothing has changed but the prices.”

      <div id="review2" class="review"> “Love top dog. Such a Berkeley classic with excellent hot dogs!  Everything is amazing, but my favorite was the bratwurst.  Their sauerkraut is amazing, too.  I frequented 
                                this place when I went to Berkeley and it never disappointed. Just checked their website and apparently I can relive my glory days at Cal by ordering at least $150 worth of sausages and buns by mail!”
