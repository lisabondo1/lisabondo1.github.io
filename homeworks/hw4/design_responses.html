					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> That there are specific guidelines as to how you can make colors on your website more accessible. I also did not know about focus state contrast, but it would have been nice with some example as I still do not quite understand the concept. I hope we will work more with accessible UI in future classes!</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I appreciate that they suggest relying on more than just color, but also icons. In general, I also think it is good that there is more focus on accessibility in web design. There are a lot of regulations on accessibility in public spaces, but very few in web design.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Lastly, the most important aspect of creating an accessible color system is giving your team the ability to reference it when needed, so everyone is clear about proper usage" </p>
						</li>
