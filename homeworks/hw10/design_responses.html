						<li>
							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I am already aware of the psychological factors at play. I think the article simplifies the theory a bit and I believe that we cannot seperate the four phases of perception to one ending before the other one starts. 
								I think the concept of cognitive overload is very important to think about when designing, and to realize how much content on a website is actually ignored by the user. 
								I also think Hick's law is important to think about when designing, although it does not really give any pointers on when we reach a point of too much content or information.
