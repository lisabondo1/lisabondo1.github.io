						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there are general guidelines to the speed of animations and that these are based on human cognition. 
								It's also interesting to learn how easing is used when it is not something, you usually would realize is an animation when interacting with it. 
								The different type of curves that can be included into the web design is very inspriring, and I hope we learn more on how to implement these in our designs.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The animations included in the article with the corresponding curves. I also think it's great that they included tools to help you create these animations. 
								The fact of having animations similar to the real world interaction with objects is interesting because I don't know how or whether these associations actually translate into interacting with products in the real world - in order words, whether they are actual interface metaphors or rather, idioms.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface." </p>
						</li>
