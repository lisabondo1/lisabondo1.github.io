					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> <a href="https://theordinary.com/en-us/multi-peptide-ha-serum-100613.html">Favorite website</a></p>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe_original.png"/>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe_new.png"/>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The website is a webshop. It is intended for skincare enthusiasts, so they focus a lot on the reviews and allow very easy an honest filtering which makes it very trustworthy to interact with.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> The lines between each description point while also using the negative space are two aspects of trying to achieve the seperation of each paragraph. I think the redesigned wireframe just using white space will serve the same purpose but with less clutter. Furthermore the info box was moved to the top for better balance and more focus on the CTA's. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
