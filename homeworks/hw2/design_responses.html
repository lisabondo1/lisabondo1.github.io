							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think the claim of users always being open to scroll is pretty interesting. I think there is a lot to consider of the purpose of your website/app 
								and whether it is always a good idea to add more whitespace. In my experience, platform-based websites where you need to continuously interact with 
								different aspects of the website having to scroll back and fourth can be quite limiting to the experience. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I appreciate the point of adding more white space and that it alligns well with the Gestalt principle of proximity. I think the idea of negative space adding more focus on CTAs makes a lot of sense. However, I think it is a bit simplified to say that more white space will necesarily create a better UI. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Users will scroll and scroll some more. I promise you. There is this myth that users will not always scroll to see all the content on a page. Thus, some of our stakeholders request that the majority of a pageâ€™s content lives above the fold. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 4. I don't appreciate the lack of references to research and simplification of principles stating them as facts rather than guidelines that differ depending on context. </p>
