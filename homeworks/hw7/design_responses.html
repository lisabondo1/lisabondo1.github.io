						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I was already familiar with Gestalt principles and how these can be applied in graphical design. I was, however, not aware of the common region principle, but I have always thought of the idea behind this principle as part of the law of continuation. I think it is always nice to see examples of these principles, and it always adds new perspectives on how you can use knowledge on human perception in designing better user interfaces.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I appreciate the conclusion of how user interface design is more than nice graphics and how the most important part is creating designs that are easy to navigate in. A big part of this is applying the principles from how humans think and perceive elements. It would have been nice to see good and bad examples from actual websites too. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience." </p>
						</li>
