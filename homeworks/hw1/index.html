	<li><em>What is something you learned from this article?</em>
		To break down the content of websites or apps in order to get a better overview on how to design them. Sometimes when you see the final result, you end up ignoring all the little aspects which makes it difficult doing your own designs.</li>
	<li><em>What was your favorite part of this article?</em> It is always nice when there are specific examples. The gifs nicely showed how it is actually built up. The observations were nice in the way that they did not specifically conclude anything but merely gave some food for thought.</li>
