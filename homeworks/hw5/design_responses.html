                            <p> That you can actually do a lot of cool animations with just CSS and HTML. I think there are a lot of the ideas that make sense to implement for the users to have a better experience and to better understand what is happening. However, I also think some of the animations are exagerated and can end up being distracting.  </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Getting inspiration for what I might be able to include in future web designs. I also find it interesting to make myself aware of which animations I find exaggerated and unnecessary. I hope that we will learn more about how to implement these animations or possibly get some supplementary material on it. </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The sliding in the solution "Index&Sidebar Animation by Arvin" is very sothing to me. I don't think it is distracting from the purpose of the task but rather makes for an experience that is related to one you would have when moving similar objects in real life. I think in general, the examples that are reminding me of how you would interact with similar physical objects are the solutions that resonate with me the most. Another example that I really like is Shazam style shopping UI by Cuberto. </p>

                            <p> 7. I enjoyed seeing the examples but it would have been great to gain some insight into how it is implemented and also what the idea and affordances behind it are. </p>
