						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> That the font you choose is heavily dependent on the message you want to convey as well as what the target group of your website is. Another interesting aspect is how pairing different fonts can be difficult and that some fonts are better suited for headers and others for body text. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I appreciate that they mention to take inspiration from other websites as familirity is a big part of the UX of a website and consistency with similar websites is typically highly appreciated with users. Giving additional ressources to use is also a big plus. Finally, I think it is a good idea to create a typography styleguide along with the rest of your styleguide as it makes a lot of design decisions easier later on. </p>
